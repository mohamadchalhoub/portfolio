# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System Setup

## Overview
This portfolio now includes a RAG system that provides intelligent, context-aware responses about Mohamad's skills, projects, and experience. The system uses semantic search and knowledge retrieval to generate accurate responses.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Portfolio Knowledge Base (`lib/rag.ts`)
- Comprehensive information about Mohamad's skills, projects, and experience
- Structured data for easy retrieval and context generation
- Keyword-based relevance scoring for intelligent search

### 2. RAG API (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Updated chat endpoint to use the RAG system
- Context retrieval before response generation
- Intelligent response generation based on portfolio knowledge

### 3. Enhanced Chatbot
- Now uses RAG for more accurate and contextual responses
- Can answer questions about specific skills, projects, and experience
- Provides detailed information based on the portfolio content

## Features

### âœ… Current Capabilities
- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant information based on user queries
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Generates responses using retrieved context
- **Portfolio Knowledge**: Access to detailed information about skills, projects, and experience
- **Intelligent Routing**: Routes queries to appropriate response handlers
- **No External Dependencies**: Works without requiring API keys initially

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
- **Vector Embeddings**: Integration with OpenAI embeddings for better semantic search
- **LLM Integration**: Use of GPT or other language models for response generation
- **Dynamic Content**: Real-time updates to the knowledge base
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for different languages
- **Advanced Analytics**: Track user interactions and improve responses

## How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: User asks a question
2. **Context Retrieval**: System searches the knowledge base for relevant information
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Calculates how well each piece of information matches the query
4. **Response Generation**: Creates a contextual response using the retrieved information
5. **Response Delivery**: Sends the intelligent response back to the user

## Example Queries

The RAG system can now handle questions like:
- "What are your technical skills?"
- "Tell me about your projects"
- "What's your GitHub profile?"
- "How can I contact you?"
- "What's your work experience?"
- "What technologies do you use?"

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Dependencies
The required packages have been installed:
```bash
npm install @langchain/openai langchain
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Optional)
For future LLM integration, create a `.env.local` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Testing
The system works immediately without additional setup. Test it by:
1. Opening the chatbot
2. Asking questions about skills, projects, or experience
3. Observing the intelligent, context-aware responses

## Customization

### Adding New Knowledge
Edit the `PORTFOLIO_KNOWLEDGE` constant in `lib/rag.ts` to add:
- New skills or technologies
- Additional projects
- Updated work experience
- New contact information

### Modifying Response Logic
Update the `generateResponse` method in `lib/rag.ts` to:
- Add new query patterns
- Modify response formats
- Include additional context

## Benefits of RAG

1. **Accuracy**: Responses are based on actual portfolio data
2. **Context**: Provides relevant information for each query
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new knowledge and capabilities
4. **User Experience**: More helpful and informative responses
5. **Professional**: Demonstrates technical expertise in AI/ML

## Next Steps

1. **Test the System**: Try various queries to see the improvements
2. **Customize Content**: Update the knowledge base with your actual information
3. **Enhance Responses**: Add more sophisticated response generation logic
4. **LLM Integration**: When ready, integrate with OpenAI or other LLM services

## Support

The RAG system is designed to be self-contained and easy to maintain. All code is well-documented and follows best practices for scalability and maintainability.
