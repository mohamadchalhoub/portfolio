# Enhanced RAG System: Portfolio + General Questions

## Overview
Your portfolio chatbot now has an enhanced RAG system that can handle both portfolio-specific questions AND general questions! This creates a more versatile and helpful AI assistant.

## 🚀 New Capabilities

### 1. **Portfolio Questions** (Primary Focus)
- Technical skills and expertise
- Projects and work experience
- GitHub and LinkedIn profiles
- Contact information
- Professional background

### 2. **General Questions** (Secondary Capability)
- Weather, math, recipes
- Entertainment recommendations
- General knowledge
- Helpful suggestions and resources

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Smart Query Routing**
1. **Input Analysis**: System analyzes if the question is portfolio-related
2. **Portfolio Questions**: Uses RAG system with your knowledge base
3. **General Questions**: Routes to AI integration service
4. **Fallback**: Provides helpful guidance if neither system can help

### **Portfolio Detection**
The system automatically detects portfolio-related queries using keywords:
- `mohamad`, `chalhoub`, `portfolio`
- `skill`, `project`, `experience`
- `github`, `linkedin`, `contact`
- `technology`, `code`, `developer`

## 📁 Files Added/Modified

### **New Files:**
- `lib/ai-integration.ts` - Handles general questions
- `ENHANCED_RAG_GUIDE.md` - This guide

### **Modified Files:**
- `lib/rag.ts` - Enhanced with comprehensive response handling
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Updated to use new system

## 🎯 Example Interactions

### **Portfolio Questions:**
```
User: "What are your technical skills?"
Bot: [Detailed response about your React, Node.js, Python skills, etc.]

User: "Tell me about your projects"
Bot: [Information about your e-commerce platform, task management app, etc.]
```

### **General Questions:**
```
User: "What's the weather like?"
Bot: "I can't provide real-time weather information, but I can help you find weather apps or websites. For current weather, try checking weather.com or your local weather service.

💡 Note: I'm primarily designed to help with questions about Mohamad's portfolio. For more detailed general assistance, consider using a general AI assistant."

User: "Tell me a joke"
Bot: "I'm focused on being helpful rather than entertaining, but I can recommend some great comedy podcasts or shows! What would you like help with?"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### **1. OpenAI Integration (Optional)**
For enhanced general responses, add your OpenAI API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Benefits:**
- More sophisticated general responses
- Better understanding of complex queries
- Professional AI capabilities

### **2. Rule-Based Fallback (Default)**
If no OpenAI key is provided, the system uses intelligent rule-based responses:
- Pre-defined patterns for common questions
- Helpful suggestions and resource recommendations
- Graceful degradation

## 🎨 Customization

### **Adding New Portfolio Keywords**
Edit `lib/rag.ts` in the `isPortfolioRelated` method:
```typescript
private isPortfolioRelated(query: string): boolean {
  const portfolioKeywords = [
    'mohamad', 'chalhoub', 'portfolio', 'skill', 'project', 'experience',
    'work', 'job', 'github', 'linkedin', 'contact', 'email', 'technology',
    'tech', 'code', 'developer', 'programming', 'software', 'web', 'app',
    'react', 'next', 'node', 'python', 'database', 'aws', 'docker',
    // Add your custom keywords here
    'your_custom_keyword'
  ];
  
  return portfolioKeywords.some(keyword => query.includes(keyword));
}
```

### **Adding New General Question Patterns**
Edit `lib/ai-integration.ts` in the `generateRuleBasedResponse` method:
```typescript
if (queryLower.includes('your_topic')) {
  return {
    text: "Your custom response here",
    source: 'Rule-based',
    confidence: 0.8,
  };
}
```
