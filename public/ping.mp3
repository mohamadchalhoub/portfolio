# IMPORTANT: This file needs to be replaced with an actual MP3 file!

# To fix the sound issue, you need to:

# OPTION 1: Download a free ping sound
# - Go to https://freesound.org/ and search for "ping" or "notification"
# - Download a short MP3 file (1-2 seconds)
# - Rename it to "ping.mp3" and replace this file

# OPTION 2: Create a simple beep
# - Use online tools like https://www.soundjay.com/beep-sounds-1.html
# - Or https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/beeps/
# - Download and rename to "ping.mp3"

# OPTION 3: Use browser-compatible audio
# The chatbot now supports multiple audio formats:
# - ping.mp3 (MP3)
# - ping.wav (WAV) 
# - ping.ogg (OGG)

# RECOMMENDED: Use a short, pleasant notification sound
# - Duration: 0.5-2 seconds
# - Format: MP3, WAV, or OGG
# - Volume: Moderate (not too loud)
# - Tone: Pleasant chime or beep

# Once you add the audio file, the chatbot will play a sound
# every time the AI responds to a message!
